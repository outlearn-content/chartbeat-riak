We'll kick things of with a case study of from Kiip and how they use Riak to connect advertisers and app makers. Next in line will be an overview from Basho on what Riak is good at. To round out the background, you'll get a sense of why Chartbeat is using Riak.

The next two modules will help you get an overview of the concepts underlying Riak as well as get a working environment up and running. We'll then dive right into using Python for CRUD operations, querying, and object modeling. The Python modules will be followed by several modules on using the Riak HTTP API. The explanation of using different languages with Riak will be concluded by a module on Clojure.

The path will go out with a bang and let you put your new Riak chops into practice with a lab assignment. You'll also get a sense of what you could do next to continue to hone your Riak skills.

<!-- @section, "title": "Here is what you be able to do" -->

The focus of this path is on giving you new skills that you can put to practice. After completing all the learning in the path, you will be able to:

- Compare Riak with other NoSQL databases and also compare it with relational databases
- Install Riak on your own machine
- Perform CRUD operations in Python
- Use Python to query a Riak database
- Create Riak object models
