In prod we use Python to do our Riak magic. But when you just want to test something out real quick, the HTTP API that you can use with curl is your best bet. That's why the next few modules will get you familiar with the HTTP API so that you can use it for quick testing and prototyping while you develop in Python. Reviewing the HTTP API is also a good way to review a lot of Riak's capabilities. You don't need to master everything in the HTTP API modules. Just consider them a great resource that helps you get things doing more quickly. It'll be good to try out several of the examples just so you get the hang of it. Pick whatever suits your fancy. Then review the rest enough that you'll be able to find it when you need it in the future.

Happy hacking!
