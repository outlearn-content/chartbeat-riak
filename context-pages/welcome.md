Hi team.  Welcome to Chartbeat's Taste of Riak!

As you know, we're serious about Riak for some of our new projects. I've worked with Wes and our friends at Outlearn to put together this path to make sure we're all on the same page about the basics of Riak.

Most of the stuff in the path comes from the official docs but we've chosen only those pieces that are most relevant and ordered them to save you from navigating the complicated docs site. We also spiced things up with some other third party resources and finished the path with modules that talk about how we use Riak at Chartbeat.

Inside the modules there are many small and some larger tasks. The idea is that you can get your hands dirty and really apply what you learn. Do try them out and when you get stuck, ask one of the other people going through the path. If you can't figure it out together, feel free to reach out to Wes and me.

Taste of Riak is a pilot both for us and Outlearn. I would love to hear any feedback and so would they. There's a widget in the platform for comments, bug reports, etc. Don't be shy to use it, I want to make sure that the experience works for you guys. And since the content is all on Github, if you want to improve something directly, go ahead and submit a pull request!

Good luck!

Nathan
